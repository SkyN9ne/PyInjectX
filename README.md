# ðŸ’¥ `PyInjectX` âœ¨
`PyInjectX` is a Small, Python-based, easy-to-use and simple file injection kit. 
It can be used maliciously for example by injecting malicious .DLL Dynamic Link Libraries into legitimate OS processes like `svchost.exe` or `winlogon.exe` / `wininit.exe`

Or it can be used for good too! You could add further customization or play around with modding games (pls don't use unfair ones online like `GodMode` or `NoClip`
